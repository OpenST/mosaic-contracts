# Mosaic Contracts Change Log

## Version 0.10.0 ⚓️ Anchor

<!-- [**Release 0.10.0, (<date-here>)**](https://github.com/OpenSTFoundation/mosaic-contracts/releases/tag/0.10.0) -->

A gateway for a given EIP20 token is comprised of a `EIP20Gateway` contract on origin  and a corresponding `EIP20CoGateway` contract on auxiliary.
On auxiliary there is an ERC20 utility token contract that mints and burns utility tokens.
It atomically mirrors tokens staked and unstaked on the origin chain.

Atomicity is achieved using a 2-phase message passing architecture between the chains.
Messages are declared on the source chain and confirmed on the target chain.
In order to confirm a message, a facilitator uses a Patricia Merkle proof once the source chain's state has been transferred to the target.
Once messages are confirmed on the target chain, the facilitator can efficiently progress them by providing the hash lock secret.
Messages can also be reverted if they are not yet completed on the target chain.

The current release uses a "anchors" to provide state roots from remote chains.

### Notable Changes

* Contracts' ABIs and BINs are provided via npm package [@openstfoundation/mosaic-contracts](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@openstfoundation/mosaic-contracts) ([#619](https://github.com/OpenSTFoundation/mosaic-contracts/pull/619), [#637](https://github.com/OpenSTFoundation/mosaic-contracts/pull/637)).
* Contracts are now separated into "Gateway" and "Core" contracts ([#221](https://github.com/OpenSTFoundation/mosaic-contracts/pull/221)).
  * Core logic is now cleanly split into a "mosaic core" and an "anchor" ([#522](https://github.com/OpenSTFoundation/mosaic-contracts/pull/522), [#549](https://github.com/OpenSTFoundation/mosaic-contracts/pull/549)).
* Gateway can now interact with decentralized mosaic core ([#463](https://github.com/OpenSTFoundation/mosaic-contracts/pull/463)).
* Gateways are now message-based ([#293](https://github.com/OpenSTFoundation/mosaic-contracts/pull/293)).
* Redeeming no longer requires a facilitator argument ([#517](https://github.com/OpenSTFoundation/mosaic-contracts/pull/517)).
* CoGateway can no longer be deactivated ([#518](https://github.com/OpenSTFoundation/mosaic-contracts/pull/518)).
* Stake and redeem now support "zero gas price" ([#521](https://github.com/OpenSTFoundation/mosaic-contracts/pull/521)).
* CoGateway no more mints zero reward amount for facilitator ([#527](https://github.com/OpenSTFoundation/mosaic-contracts/pull/527)).
* Mint and burn now changed to increase and decrease supply ([#529](https://github.com/OpenSTFoundation/mosaic-contracts/pull/529), [#540](https://github.com/OpenSTFoundation/mosaic-contracts/pull/540)).
* OST prime supply is now increased as base token ([#559](https://github.com/OpenSTFoundation/mosaic-contracts/pull/559)).
* Claim and redeem are now called unwrap and wrap. Claim and redeem events are now called token unwrapped and token wrapped ([#533](https://github.com/OpenSTFoundation/mosaic-contracts/pull/533)).
* The gateways now accept a "burner" argument. All burnt value will be sent to the burner instead ([#542](https://github.com/OpenSTFoundation/mosaic-contracts/pull/542)).
* Staker can now stake without providing signatures. This also means that there is now only one actor known to the Gateways ([#548](https://github.com/OpenSTFoundation/mosaic-contracts/pull/548)).
* Gateway and CoGateway now check that the stake/redeem amount covers at least the potential reward ([#600](https://github.com/OpenSTFoundation/mosaic-contracts/pull/600)).
* Penalty is returned to the staker and redeemer on progress stake  and progress mint, if revocation of message is declared on source chain and target is already progressed ([#576](https://github.com/OpenSTFoundation/mosaic-contracts/pull/576)).
* Anchor now stores only recent state roots ([#546](https://github.com/OpenSTFoundation/mosaic-contracts/pull/546)).
* Contracts can now be `Organized` in line with [openst-contracts](https://github.com/OpenSTFoundation/openst-contracts) ([#513](https://github.com/OpenSTFoundation/mosaic-contracts/pull/513)).
  * Gateways are now `Organized` ([#515](https://github.com/OpenSTFoundation/mosaic-contracts/pull/515)).
  * Only the organization can anchor state roots ([#560](https://github.com/OpenSTFoundation/mosaic-contracts/pull/560)).

## OpenST-protocol [v0.9.1](https://github.com/OpenSTFoundation/mosaic-contracts/releases/tag/v0.9.1) December 19 2017

OpenST v0.9.1 is the first release deployed on Ethereum mainnet combined with the
activation of Simple Token to power the OpenST platform.  The OpenST platform
allows Ethereum smart contracts to runs faster and cheaper while leveraging
the security properties of Ethereum's Proof-of-Work.  In this release we implement
the first corner stone of the protocol: the ability to stake value on Ethereum
mainnet and mint a new representation of that value on a utility chain,
effectively increasing the computational throughput of Ethereum smart contracts
by allowing parallel execution across chains.

OpenST smart contracts have been restructured to store value separately from
the logic that implements the protocol.  v0.9.1 is not yet protocol complete
as the validators are whitelisted and not yet open with stake put forward on
Ethereum mainnet.  However, by splitting the protocol implementation into
these two logically separate problems, we can already start working with
member companies and developers to fine-tune the APIs and the developer
experience to build mainstream applications on Ethereum.
